# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-30)

**Core value:** A VA can sign in via an admin invite, work through assigned programs and courses on their own time, take quizzes and submit assignments without supervision, and receive a certificate when they finish. Admins can author content, manage learners, review submissions, and see who is making progress without leaving the platform.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — auth-and-access-hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (auth-and-access-hardening) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 01.1 inserted after Phase 1: Testing Coverage Parity: bring repo to Sandra CRM testing standard (RTL config, Playwright e2e dir, deps, scripts) and replace phase 1 HUMAN-UAT items with automated specs (URGENT)

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone init: First GSD-managed milestone is a hardening pass, not features. Coarse granularity, parallel execution, YOLO mode.
- TDD rule: Test inventory must be enumerated and approved before any tests or code are written.
- [Phase ?]: Path A locked: e2e fixtures expose adminClient + ensureTestUser + prod-ref guard only; write-path helpers deferred until Path B/C lock
- [Phase ?]: BMH e2e fixtures use untyped SupabaseClient (src/lib/supabase/types.ts does not exist; TYPE-01 territory in Phase 4)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- TYPE-01 (Supabase type generation) is a prerequisite for tight test fixtures in TEST-01..03. Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 completing first to stabilize the migration surface before generating types.
- Integration tests (TEST-02) run against the production Supabase project. No writes in integration tests without explicit confirmation of safe harness setup.
