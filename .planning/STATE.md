# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-30)

**Core value:** A VA can sign in via an admin invite, work through assigned programs and courses on their own time, take quizzes and submit assignments without supervision, and receive a certificate when they finish. Admins can author content, manage learners, review submissions, and see who is making progress without leaving the platform.
**Current focus:** Phase 01.1 — testing-coverage-parity

## Current Position

Phase: 01.1 (testing-coverage-parity) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3 (Plans 1 and 3 complete; Plan 2 pending merge from worktree)
Status: Plans 01.1-1 and 01.1-3 merged to main; merging Plan 01.1-2 next
Last activity: 2026-05-01 -- Plans 01.1-1 and 01.1-3 merged to main

Progress: [███████░░░] 71%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1 (in Phase 01.1)
- Average duration: ~5 min
- Total execution time: ~5 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01.1 | 1 | ~5 min | ~5 min |

**Recent Trend:**

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01.1 P3 | 7min | 3 tasks | 5 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 01.1 inserted after Phase 1: Testing Coverage Parity: bring repo to Sandra CRM testing standard (RTL config, Playwright e2e dir, deps, scripts) and replace phase 1 HUMAN-UAT items with automated specs (URGENT)

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone init: First GSD-managed milestone is a hardening pass, not features. Coarse granularity, parallel execution, YOLO mode.
- TDD rule: Test inventory must be enumerated and approved before any tests or code are written.
- 2026-05-01 (Plan 01.1-1): RTL config and setup mirror Sandra CRM verbatim including the localStorage shim. Vitest 4 transforms TSX natively so no @vitejs/plugin-react. Failing-tests commit lands with HUSKY=0 because the harness has not been installed yet; the harness commit runs the full hook end-to-end.
- 2026-05-01 (Plan 01.1-3): storage-state strategy locked as in-spec opt-out via test.use storageState empty — Option 1, smallest delta, no learner-only account on prod
- 2026-05-01 (Plan 01.1-3): Path A locked — destructive HARDEN-02 and HARDEN-03 UI variant remain manual until a write-capable test environment exists
- 2026-05-01 (Plan 01.1-3): 01-HUMAN-UAT.md status changed to closed-with-deferrals; file is a closed historical record

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- TYPE-01 (Supabase type generation) is a prerequisite for tight test fixtures in TEST-01..03. Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 completing first to stabilize the migration surface before generating types.
- Integration tests (TEST-02) run against the production Supabase project. No writes in integration tests without explicit confirmation of safe harness setup.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Role-play embed | EMBD-01..05 | v2 | Milestone init |
| Performance | PERF-01..03 | v2 | Milestone init |
